<h1>About this blog</h1>
<p>For the first time after 3 and a half years in university, I finally find time to enjoy life again. No more gruelling
    6-to-9 weekdays of classes and ACM-ICPC training. No more brutal semesters with 7 projects hammering down at the
    same time - sure, my thesis is still there, but it's pretty cushy once I am done with the DL model. And I even got
    myself a pretty good job, too, so I don't need to worry about what to do once I go independent from my parents.</p>
<p>Now, I have all the time in the world to do all the things I wanted to do. All the things that I missed out after all
    these years! Reading the novels I bought from Singapore, playing the library of games I stacked up in my Steam
    account, my PS4 and Switch, or reuniting with long lost friends. The possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>But instead of doing any of that, let's make another blog!</p>

<p>It's interesting how every once in a while, the idea of writing would come back to me. I would think about ways to
    revitalize my old blog Cowboy Coder, and would go so far as to redesign and code modern versions of it myself - this
    website was actually my second attempt at doing just that. But once the technical part is finished, I would always
    be too busy to migrate posts from the old site to the new, let alone writing new posts, and the new design always
    ended up recycled for a different purpose or abandoned.</p>
<p>This time, after one and half a year in the unused dust bin, I decided to turn this blog theme into my personal blog.

<h1>What to expect</h1>
<p>I think I'm mostly known for my hardcore passion for computer programming and my achievements as a student. But
    outside of those, I'm also a normal guy with hobbies <sup>and feelings too but we don't talk too much about
        that</sup>.
    I love techs and games - which are pretty basic I guess, and don't stray too far away from my job - but I love them
    nevertheless. I would love to talk about how a new smart device attracted my attention or how a game deeply touched
    my soul. But I know not a whole lot of people on my friendlist would be interested in such posts. Worst case
    scenario, they may get the wrong impression of me being an arrogant, bragging smartass if I keep talking about the
    toys I bought.</p>
<p>By posting about these on my personal blog, I will not clog up other people's news feed, while still be able to write
    about the things I like to my heart's content. It's my personal safe space.</p>
<p>Expect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shameless flexes of techs I own and my thoughts about them.<br /><img

    <li>Reviews about songs, movies and games that touched my soul (especially Kingdom Hearts and The Legend of Zelda,
        I'm deep into these).<br /><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YWUpVw86AtIbe/giphy.gif" alt=""

    <li>Personal stories of my life.<br /><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6MbgA9AL2Gg24klq/giphy.gif" alt=""
            style="max-height: 200px;" /></li>
    <li>Software development too. I love writing about it, so I may share new things I learned on this blog.<br /><img

    <li>Shitposts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had two edgy blogs before and I freaking hate those&nbsp;<sup>although I think everyone hates their past childish
        selves to a certain degree </sup>so I promise I will try my best to keep this one edge-free and non-cynical. But
    do expect snarky remarks because I love sarcasm.</p>
<p>Andddd I guess that's it. Go read my blog posts - I heard they are very interesting, more so than this introduction
    page :D</p>
